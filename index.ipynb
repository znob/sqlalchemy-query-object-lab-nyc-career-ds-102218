Well, fortunately the SQLAlchemy library provides all of that code for us already so we can get to querying right away!  In this lab we will use SQLAlchemy's `query()` method to find information from our database and return this data to us in object format."

    "3.  Use `order_by` to order resulting data and use `desc` to order from highest to lowest\n",
